## ðŸ”§ Optimizing Data Models

- Use **Star Schema** instead of snowflake for better performance.
- Remove **unnecessary columns and tables** to reduce model size.
- Rename columns and tables with meaningful names for clarity.
- Use **numeric** or **whole number keys** for relationships over strings.
- Set proper **data types** (date, text, decimal, etc.).
- Use **Power Query** to do heavy data transformation, not DAX.
- Turn off **Auto Date/Time** under Options â†’ Data Load for better performance.

## ðŸ”— Working with Relationships and Cardinality

- Prefer **Single Direction** relationships unless required otherwise.
- Understand **Cardinality**:
  - **One-to-Many (1:\*)**: Most common and preferred.
  - **Many-to-Many (\*:\*)**: Use only when necessary with caution.
- Avoid circular or ambiguous relationships.
- Use **COMPOSITE MODE** to mix Import and DirectQuery for flexibility.
- Check and fix **inactive relationships** (gray dotted lines in the model view).
- Use `USERELATIONSHIP()` DAX when multiple relationships exist.

## ðŸ“ˆ Creating Dynamic Visuals with DAX

- **Measure branching**: Define base measures first, then build on them.
- Use `SELECTEDVALUE()` to detect slicer selection.
- Use `SWITCH(TRUE(), ...)` pattern for dynamic logic.
- Create **dynamic titles** using DAX:


Title = "Sales Report for " & SELECTEDVALUE(Region[RegionName], "All Regions")

### ðŸ“Š Best Practices for Dashboards
Start with a clear business question.

Maintain a consistent color theme and font.

Use tooltips, bookmarks, and drill-throughs for interactivity.

Avoid overcrowding visuals â€” use whitespace wisely.

Use KPI cards, bar/column charts, and slicers smartly.

Always test performance using Performance Analyzer in Power BI Desktop.

Ensure mobile layout is optimized.
